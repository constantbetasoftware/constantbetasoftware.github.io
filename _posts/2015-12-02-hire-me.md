### Index: [You](#about-you), [My Services](#worry-not-sauls-im-here), [Me](#why-me), [How](#how-much-and-how-does-it-work)

Hi there. If you need some **help** and are ok with **remote work**, then keep reading.
If not, you can keep reading anyway!



### About You

So you run a tech company and need some help with your product. Some common scenarios:

- You're working on something but not sure if it'll hit Product/Market fit;

- You just released something but it has been largely ignored by your target market;

- Your users are installing your app but dropping like flies and you have no idea how to fix it (retention, retention, retention);

- You have a decent product but need help making it 5 Stars;

- You've just gone through the "Techcrunch of Initiation" and are starting to feel the "Wearing Off of Novelty" (as described in [PG's Startup Curve](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=173261){:target="_blank"}) and need help to sail through it as fast and seamlessly as possible;

- v1 was good, but now it's time for v2 and you wanna make sure you're going the right way (a variation of the previous point);

- Just wanna talk.



### Worry not, <s>Saul's</s> I'm here!

*I'm #1 on your speed dial, right next to your weed dealer. Please, <a href="mailto:contact@constantbetasoftware.com">email me</a>.*

On a more serious note, here's some of what I have to offer:

- A complete teardow of your product (analysis and review) - similar to the posts I write, but with even more detail. I'll review your product and point out problems and propose solutions.

- Help with Product/Company Strategy. Not sure you're going the right way? Is it time to pivot? I'll be the one stopping you (or pushing you).

- General Product and Project Management. Meaning I can help reorganize and prioritize your Backlog. You're using some kind of agile methodology, right? Right???

- Connect you with Great (and affordable) Engineers/Designers that can help you build your product.

So I'm basically like a Management Consultant for Tech Companies. But unlike *most* Management Consultants, I'm actually worth it. Trust me, I'm an Engineer.



### Why me?

So why should you pay me the big bucks for something that exists in abundance around the Bay Area/NYC/London/Berlin/etc? We all know that, in the current boom, there is no lack of PMs and Wannabe-PMs with great resumes and/or MBAs coming out of Stanford's GSB or Consultants and Wall-Streeters wanting to jump into Tech.

Here are a few reasons to go with &lt;unknown person&gt;:

* You liked what you've read so far. You felt like the blog posts were a-w-e-s-o-m-e and you could really connect and agree with what I wrote.
Or even if you didn't agree, you felt like I'm the kind of person you just have to meet.

* My background: I belong to multiple cultures. I have a Comp Sci education. I've been coding since I was a *kid* (whatdoyoumean, I'm no longer a kid???).
Back in the 90s I was trying out all the shareware I could find. These days I'm always looking for cool apps for my iOS and Android devices.
I'm an Early Adopter. And a Maker. And I generate more ideas than I can work on.

* My experience: I've worked in Academia. I've worked in the Corporate World. I've worked in startups. I've freelanced. I've built my own projects.
Mobile and Backend and Web Frontend, what they call Full Stack. Basically, I've learned a lot.

* My personality: We haven't met but you already know you love me. It's love at first GET (rah, bad HTTP joke!).
Here's what else you'll get: Straight to the point. Risk taker. I try to make it easy to talk about the hard things. And lots of laughs.

How can you say no?



### How much and how does it work?

There is no fixed price. The cost really depends on what kind of help you need and how long it will take.
But I don't charge hourly, unless it makes sense for you, i.e. it's better for you.

This is how it works:

![The Process](/resources/2015-12-02-hire-me/process1.png)

Send me an email to [contact@constantbetasoftware.com](mailto:contact@constantbetasoftware.com) stating what you need help with, your contact (skype, phone, whatever), your availability and other relevant information. We'll chat and decide if we're going forward.

![The Process](/resources/2015-12-02-hire-me/process2.png)

Then I'll be meditating on your problems and doing my Herculean labours, so I can get back to you with my results. From there, we'll be going back and forth in a very tight loop until things are done.<br />
Because what I actually care about is customer satisfaction, if you find yourself unsatisfied with my results or you just think you actually don't need my help, you're more than welcome to terminate our agreement.

If you're satisfied, then we'll always be keeping in touch, because good relationships shouldn't just disappear!
