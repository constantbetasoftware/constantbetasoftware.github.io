A recommended reading to get a little understanding of how things operate on the other side of the World.

["More Chinese Mobile UI Trends"](http://dangrover.com/blog/2015/01/31/more-chinese-mobile-ui-trends.html){:target="_blank"} [^1]
and ["Chinese Mobile App UI Trends" (December 2014)](http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html){:target="_blank"}

Quick Summary:

- user ranks (i.e. gamification)
- chaotic overlays (if you thought Snapchat was confusing then you're in for a treat)
- weird icons ('cause it's Asia)
- they type differently over there (which translates into a different use case for the keyboard)
- custom browsers (oh boy...)
- limited connectivity (which reminds me that [you should read this](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm){:target="_blank"}, icymi)
- 1 click buy (suck it, amazon!)
- bots! (take that, google!)
