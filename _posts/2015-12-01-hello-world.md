Welcome to constant beta software, a blog where I write about technology, startups and their products.

I view this as an exercise to improve my own product management and building skills but also as a platform for exposing some thoughts.

So don't be ofended by anything you might read here. It's not personal. It's not you, it's me.

Also, the analysis and criticisms will not be necessarily data focused because unfortunately I don't really have any inside knowledge about how well the targets are doing.
I don't expect people to agree with what I write and I'm open to being corrected by any facts, because even though I'm opinionated, I'm not dogmatic (but I might sound like it).

That's all, let's start.
