title: Nick Baum on Being a PM at Google
---

Here's an interesting take at what being a Product Manager at Google means.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I realized this weekend that it&#39;s my fault that <a href="https://twitter.com/google">@Google</a> shut down Google Reader. /1</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775176446318776325">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was the PM from 06-07. We launched a major redesign that significantly changed our growth rate... but didn&#39;t take us to &quot;Google scale&quot;. /2</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775176787022127104">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I used to think it was unfair and short-sighted that Google didn&#39;t give us enough resources to execute to our full potential. /3</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775177114542714880">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">... but as a founder, I know resources aren&#39;t something you are owed or deserve.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I should have realized that not reaching ~100m actives was an existential threat, and worked to convince the team to focus 100% on that. /5</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775178088397217792">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I should have prioritized agreeing on a bigger and riskier plan that would have given us even a remote chance of hitting those numbers. /6</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775179247551778816">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I should have sold that vision to our execs, and if they still didn&#39;t buy it, I should have tried to make it work anyway. Like a founder. /7</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775179660674031616">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Reader was one of my favorite projects. I loved working with that team, some of the best people I&#39;ve had a chance to work with. /8</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775180114233593856">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t know if doing these things would have been enough, but I now see that it was my job as PM to see the threat and do something. /9</p>&mdash; Nick Baum (@nickbaum) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/775181228228038658">September 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

PS: Is it me or Twitter has no native way of embedding a tweetstorm?
I'm aware of services that do this, but come on, that's disappointing and points to something major blocking execution at Twitter HQ.
